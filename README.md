# Data-Science-Tools

Useful Data Science/Statistical tools for manipulating data

I wish to explore my increasing interest in data science, by looking at some of commonly used techniques, and attempting to write code to solve them. In some cases, I use built-in modules (like scikit-learn); in other cases, I code it up from scratch, especially if there is some pedagogical value to doing so. 
This is a large, large field, and I can only explore so much! 

Included are: regression, SVM classification, clustering, kernel density estimation
What I hope to explore as well: outlier detection, Neural Networks, Dimensionality Reduction, Topological data analysis
